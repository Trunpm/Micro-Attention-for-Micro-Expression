# Introduction

This repository contains the Micro Attention module described in the paper 
"Micro-Attention for Micro-Expression recognition" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02360). 

Micro-Attention outperformed the method described in the paper 
"From Macro to Micro Expression Recognition: Deep Learning on Small Datasets Using Transfer Learning", 
the latter one won the first place in the Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC2018) at FG 2018.
